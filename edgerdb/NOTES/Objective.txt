This project will provide an easy way for someone with
a postgres server running to fill a table with sec filings
these filings for analysis.

This project will also make it possible to upload a simple program
to a server and have the server update the database automatically every
day for further analysis, or to alert the user of new company filings
that may impact the price of their stock.

This project will also allow a user to select certain rows containing
the path to the filings that interest them and will download the filings
into another table or directory where they can be scraped and analyzed to
determine the impact the filing may have on the price of the stock.  These fillings
will include financial statements from publicly traded company, which can be used
to automate company valuations to help stock trading bots buy undervalued stocks
and stay clear of over-valued ones.

My final goal is to grow this project into a stock trading bot based on genetic
algorithms that
